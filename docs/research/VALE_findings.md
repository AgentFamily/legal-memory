### Key Insights from VALE Feasibility Study

**Market Size:** The legal services market is valued at $400B+ globally, with legal tech AI solutions capturing 12–15% CAGR.

### However: The Memory Gap

Despite high adoption, **only 12% of firms have integrated institutional memory systems**:

**This is the white space LegalMemory™ addresses.**

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Focus | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Westlaw AI | Case research tool | Limited institutional memory; part of larger suite |
| LexisNexis+ AI | Precedent search | No document recall; no compliance archive |
| Relativity Assist | E-discovery | Complex, expensive; not SaaS-optimized for small–mid firms |
| ChatGPT Legal Plugins | Generic legal Q&A | No institutional knowledge; compliance liability |
| **LegalMemory™** | **Institutional memory + compliance + litigation intel** | **First-to-market integrated platform** |

---

## Market Entry Strategy (VALE Recommendation)

**Entry Point:** Mid-market firms (50–250 attorneys)
- Largest pain point = institutional knowledge loss
- Price-sensitive but willing to pay for demonstrable ROI
- Slower to adopt than enterprise but loyal once onboarded

**Key GTM Lever:** Deep integration with **managing partner networks** and **chief legal officer communities** (bars associations, firm networks, industry events).
